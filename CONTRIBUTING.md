# Contribute to the RGI user guide

This documentation is written in the [markdown format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and rendered to a website with the [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org) tool. You will find all necessary help about the markdown format on their documentation.

You can explore the markdown files by exploring [this repository](https://github.com/GLIMS-RGI/rgi_user_guide) on github 
or by downloading it. The structure of the repository should be self explanatory after a bit of exploration. 
In case of doubt, each page on the [website](https://glims-rgi.github.io/user_guide) offers a "download" button in the 
top right allowing to download the file displayed on screen.

To contribute text or content, you have several choices (by order of less work for the maintainers):
1. Modify the file on github directly or by opening a pull-request. This requires a github account, and some knowledge about its functioning. If you are unfamiliar with github and have no time to learn, move to 2.
2. Download the file you want to edit, make the edits in the the markdown file, and send it to me. This requires downloading the files, and to understand the basic structure of the documentation.
3. Finally, if it is easiest for you, you can send me your feedback or change request per mail.
