# Contribute to the RGI user guide and technical note

This documentation is written in the markdown format and rendered to a website with the [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org) tool. You will find all necessary help about the markdown format on their documentation.

You can explore the markdown files in [this repository](https://github.com/GLIMS-RGI/rgi_user_guide). The structure should be self explanatory, but in case of doubt, each page in the documentation offers a download button in the top right, allowing to download the file displayed on screen.

To contribute text or content, the best is to modify the file on github directly - this requires a github account, and some knowledge about its functioning. The second best is to edit the markdown files you downloaded, and send them to me. Finally, if it is easiest for you, you can send me your feedback or text changes per mail or word document.
