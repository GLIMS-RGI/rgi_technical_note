abstract = {This study presents a new method to derive centerlines for the main branches and major tributaries of a set of glaciers, requiring glacier outlines and a digital elevation model (DEM) as input. The method relies on a "cost grid–least-cost route approach" that comprises three main steps. First, termini and heads are identified for every glacier. Second, centerlines are derived by calculating the least-cost route on a previously established cost grid. Third, the centerlines are split into branches and a branch order is allocated. Application to 21 720 glaciers in Alaska and northwest Canada (Yukon, British Columbia) yields 41 860 centerlines. The algorithm performs robustly, requiring no manual adjustments for 87.8{\%} of the glaciers. Manual adjustments are required primarily to correct the locations of glacier heads (7.0{\%} corrected) and termini (3.5{\%} corrected). With corrected heads and termini, only 1.4{\%} of the derived centerlines need edits. A comparison of the lengths from a hydrological approach to the lengths from our longest centerlines reveals considerable variation. Although the average length ratio is close to unity, only {\~{}} 50{\%} of the 21 720 glaciers have the two lengths within 10{\%} of each other. A second comparison shows that our centerline lengths between lowest and highest glacier elevations compare well to our longest centerline lengths. For {\textgreater} 70{\%} of the 4350 glaciers with two or more branches, the two lengths are within 5{\%} of each other. Our final product can be used for calculating glacier length, conducting length change analyses, topological analyses, or flowline modeling.},

abstract = {The second Chinese glacier inventory was compiled based on 218 Landsat TM/ETM + scenes acquired mainly during 2006–10. The widely used band ratio segmentation method was applied as the first step in delineating glacier outlines, and then intensive manual improvements were performed. The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model was used to derive altitudinal attributes of glaciers. The boundaries of some glaciers measured by real-time kinematic differential GPS or digitized from high-resolution images were used as references to validate the accuracy of the methods used to delineate glaciers, which resulted in positioning errors of ±10 m for manually improved clean-ice outlines and ±30 m for manually digitized outlines of debris-covered parts. The glacier area error of the compiled inventory, evaluated using these two positioning accuracies, was ±3.2{\%}. The compiled parts of the new inventory have a total area of 43 087 km 2 , in which 1723 glaciers were covered by debris, with a total debris-covered area of 1494 km 2 . The area of uncompiled glaciers from the digitized first Chinese glacier inventory is ∼8753 km 2 , mainly distributed in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, where no images of acceptable quality for glacier outline delineation can be found during 2006–10.},

abstract = {Abstract. We present a multi-temporal digital inventory of Svalbard glaciers with the most recent from the late 2000s containing 33 775 km2 of glaciers covering 57{\%} of the total land area of the archipelago. At present, 68{\%} of the glacierized area of Svalbard drains through tidewater glaciers that have a total terminus width of {\~{}} 740 km. The glacierized area over the entire archipelago has decreased by an average of 80 km2 a−1 over the past {\~{}} 30 yr, representing a reduction of 7{\%}. For a sample of {\~{}} 400 glaciers (10 000 km2) in the south and west of Spitsbergen, three digital inventories are available from the 1930/60s, 1990 and 2007 from which we calculate average changes during 2 epochs. In the more recent epoch, the terminus retreat was larger than in the earlier epoch, while area shrinkage was smaller. The contrasting pattern may be explained by the decreased lateral wastage of the glacier tongues. Retreat rates for individual glaciers show a mix of accelerating and decelerating trends, reflecting the large spatial variability of glacier types and climatic/dynamic response times in Svalbard. Lastly, retreat rates estimated by dividing glacier area changes by the tongue width are larger than centerline retreat due to a more encompassing frontal change estimate with inclusion of lateral area loss.},

abstract = {The consequences of global warming on land ice masses are difficult to assess in detail, as two-dimensional glacier inventory data are still missing for many remote regions of the world. As the largest future temperature increase is expected to occur at high latitudes, the glaciers and ice caps in the Arctic will be particularly susceptible to the expected warming. This study demonstrates the possibilities of space-borne glacier inventorying at a remote site on Cumberland Peninsula, a part of Baffin Island in Arctic Canada, thereby providing glacier inventory data for this region. Our approach combines Landsat ETM+ and Terra ASTER satellite data, an ASTER-derived digital elevation model (DEM) and Geographic Information System-based processing. We used thresholded ratio images from ETM+ bands 3 and 5 and ASTER bands 3 and 4 for glacier mapping. Manual delineation of Little Ice Age trimlines and moraines has been applied to calculate area changes for 225 glaciers, yielding an average area loss of 11{\%}. A size distribution has been obtained for 770 glaciers that is very different from that for Alpine glaciers. Numerous three-dimensional glacier parameters were derived from the ASTER DEM for a subset of 340 glaciers. The amount of working time required for the processing has been tracked, and resulted in 5 min per glacier, or 7 years for all estimated 160 000 glaciers worldwide.},

abstract = {We calibrate the calving parameterisation implemented in the Open Global Glacier Model via two methods (velocity constraint and surface mass balance (SMB) constraint) and assess the impact of accounting for frontal ablation on the ice volume estimate of Greenland tidewater peripheral glaciers (PGs). We estimate an average regional frontal ablation flux of 7.38±3.45 Gta −1 after calibrating the model with two different satellite velocity products, and of 0.69±0.49 Gta −1 if the model is constrained using frontal ablation fluxes derived from independent modelled SMB averaged over an equilibrium reference period (1961–90). This second method makes the assumption that most PGs during that time have an equilibrium between mass gain via SMB and mass loss via frontal ablation. This assumption serves as a basis to assess the order of magnitude of dynamic mass loss of glaciers when compared to the SMB imbalance. The differences between results from both methods indicate how strong the dynamic imbalance might have been for PGs during that reference period. Including frontal ablation increases the estimated regional ice volume of PGs, from 14.47 to 14.64±0.12 mm sea level equivalent when using the SMB method and to 15.84±0.32 mm sea level equivalent when using the velocity method.},

Ice masses have a median elevation of 776 m a.s.l. and span an altitudinal range of 290–1500 m a.s.l. Indications of ice flow suggest at least 105 active glaciers in the Torngat Mountains. Analysis of morphometric and topographic parameters suggests that the regional distribution of ice masses is linked to physiographic setting while the preservation of coastal ice masses at low elevation is related to local meteorological conditions. In the most coastal environments, ice masses are shown to exist below the regional glaciation level due to topographic shadowing, coastal proximity and widespread debris cover.

However, the apparent decrease is largely due to differences in choice of domain, as the study excludes 80{\%} of the glacier area in the Antarctic periphery that was included in previous global glacier volume estimates. The issue highlights the difficulty in separating glaciers from the ice-sheet proper, especially in Antarctica, and the need for both the glacier and ice-sheet communities to develop standards and protocols to avoid double-counting in global ice volume and mass-change assessments and projections. Process-based inversion models have replaced earlier scaling methods, but large uncertainties in global glacier volume estimation remain due to the ill-posed nature of the inversion problem and poorly constrained parameters emphasizing the need for more direct ice thickness observations.},

abstract = {Abstract. Despite their importance for sea-level rise, seasonal water availability, and as a source of geohazards, mountain glaciers are one of the few remaining subsystems of the global climate system for which no globally applicable, open source, community-driven model exists. Here we present the Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM), developed to provide a modular and open-source numerical model framework for simulating past and future change of any glacier in the world. The modeling chain comprises data downloading tools (glacier outlines, topography, climate, validation data), a preprocessing module, a mass-balance model, a distributed ice thickness estimation model, and an ice-flow model. The monthly mass balance is obtained from gridded climate data and a temperature index melt model. To our knowledge, OGGM is the first global model to explicitly simulate glacier dynamics: the model relies on the shallow-ice approximation to compute the depth-integrated flux of ice along multiple connected flow lines. In this paper, we describe and illustrate each processing step by applying the model to a selection of glaciers before running global simulations under idealized climate forcings. Even without an in-depth calibration, the model shows very realistic behavior. We are able to reproduce earlier estimates of global glacier volume by varying the ice dynamical parameters within a range of plausible values. At the same time, the increased complexity of OGGM compared to other prevalent global glacier models comes at a reasonable computational cost: several dozen glaciers can be simulated on a personal computer, whereas global simulations realized in a supercomputing environment take up to a few hours per century. Thanks to the modular framework, modules of various complexity can be added to the code base, which allows for new kinds of model intercomparison studies in a controlled environment. Future developments will add new physical processes to the model as well as automated calibration tools. Extensions or alternative parameterizations can be easily added by the community thanks to comprehensive documentation. OGGM spans a wide range of applications, from ice–climate interaction studies at millennial timescales to estimates of the contribution of glaciers to past and future sea-level change. It has the potential to become a self-sustained community-driven model for global and regional glacier evolution. ]]{\textgreater}},

The image mosaic was created from a combination of Landsat-7 and RADARSAT-1 imagery acquired between 1999 and 2002. Each pixel in the image is stamped with the acquisition date and geo-registration error to facilitate change detection. This mosaic was then used to manually produce complete ice-covered and ice-free land classification masks. Finally, we used satellite altimetry and stereo-photogrammetric digital elevation models (DEMs) to enhance an existing DEM for Greenland, substantially improving resolution and accuracy over the ice margin and periphery.},

abstract = {Abstract. A Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scene from 2003 covering the Jotunheimen and Breheimen region has been used to map the recent glacier extents using thresholded ratio images (TM3/TM5). Orthoprojected aerial photographs and glacier outlines from digital maps have been used to validate the method and control the results. We further calculated glacier changes by comparing the Landsat-derived 2003 glacier outlines with previous maps and inventories from the 1930s, 1960s and 1980s. Our results confirm that the applied automatic mapping method is robust and agrees with the reference data used. Some manual editing was necessary to correct the outline at ice-lake contacts and at debris covered glaciers. However, for most of the glaciers no corrections were required. The most laborious task has been to assign ID numbers and couple the new Landsat inventory to previous inventories to assess area changes. The glaciers investigated shrank since the 1930s with an overall area reduction of about 23{\%} for 38 glaciers. Since the 1960s the area reduction was 12{\%} for 164 glaciers. Although the general trend is glacier recession, some glaciers have increased their size or remained nearly unchanged over these decades.},

abstract = {We observed the wastage of ice masses on the Kerguelen Islands (Indian Ocean, 49°S, 69°E) using historical information and recent satellite data. Overall, the total ice-covered area on the islands declined from 703 to 552 km2 between 1963 and 2001, a reduction of 21{\%}. The area of Cook ice cap (the main ice body) decreased asymmetrically from 501 to 403 km 2. West flowing glaciers lost 11{\%} of their area, while east flowing glaciers lost 28{\%}. After 1991, the retreat rate accelerated from 1.9 km 2/a (1963-1991) to 3.8 km2/a (1991-2003). Between 1963 and 2000, the ice volume loss was 25-30 km3, equivalent to an area-average ice-thinning rate of 1.4-1.7 m/a. The glacial retreat took place in the climatic context of a relatively low level of precipitation (compared to the 1950s) and a ∼1°C warming that occurred between 1964 and 1982. The acceleration of the ice losses since at least the 1990s indicates that the state of the ice bodies on the Kerguelen Islands is still far from balanced. Together with other studies in Patagonia, South Georgia, and Heard Island, our analysis is consistent with a pattern of strong and accelerated wastage of ice masses influenced by the Southern Ocean.

However, the current overall extent of the glaciers in the region is not well known. To obtain this information, we have compiled a new inventory from two mosaicked Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes acquired in 2006 that have excellent snow conditions for glacier mapping, the first suitable scenes for this purpose after 22 years of imaging with TM. Drainage divides and topographic inventory parameters were derived from a 25 m national digital elevation model for 1450 glaciers. By digitizing glacier outlines from 1 : 50 000 scale topographic maps of 1966, we calculated changes in glacier area for {\~{}}300 glaciers. Cumulative length changes for the 1997–2006 period were derived from an additional TM scene and compared with field measurements for nine glaciers. Overall, we find a 9{\%} area loss since 1966, with a clear dependence on glacier size; however, seasonal snow in 1966 in some regions made area determination challenging. The satellite-derived length changes confirmed the observed high spatial variability and were in good agreement with field data (±1 pixel), apart from glacier tongues in cast shadow. The new inventory will be freely available from the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) glacier database.},

abstract = {The World Glacier Inventory (WGI) was conceived half a century ago as an activity to be completed during the International Geophysical Year, 1957/58. It consisted until very recently of nearly 70 000 glacier records covering slightly less than one-quarter of the glacier ice outside the ice sheets. A complete WGI must be a compromise if it is to be available and usable soon. A more complete version, called WGI-XF, is available and usable now and contains records for just over 131 000 glaciers and nearly half of the global extent of ice. The additional glaciers come mainly from the assimilation of existing inventories but also from rescuing inventories that have been lost and from new inventories in Canada and the Subantarctic. In WGI-XF, the XF stands for ‘extended format', flagging the fact that WGI-XF conforms to a set of explicit specifications which enhance usefulness by eliminating low-level inconsistencies. Two important features are nominal glaciers and glacier complexes. A nominal glacier, of which there are about 5000 in WGI-XF, is one about which little is known other than its existence and approximate location. A glacier complex is one or more contiguous glaciers. This term embodies the idea, which is not new, that inventories can be preliminary, based upon vector outlines which await subdivision by trained glaciologists. Many regional studies have found that measurements of changes in single glaciers require accurate work and painstaking quality control. WGI-XF is not assuredly reliable as a source for such detailed work, but there are several other subjects in which less detail would be a price worth paying for more complete coverage. Incomplete information about the dates of imagery and maps is a hindrance to analysis, and the recovery of dates from metadata should have high priority.},

abstract = {A glacier inventory is a fundamental tool for describing and managing the Alpine glacierized environment and evaluating the impacts of the ongoing climate change. After the 1959-1962 Italian glacier inventory published by the Italian Glaciological Committee (CGI) in cooperation with the National Research Council (CNR), only regional glacier lists have been developed in Italy, thus giving partial pictures of the evolution of the Italian glaciers. In this work, we summarized the main results from the New Italian Glacier Inventory, a national glacier atlas recently completed and based on the analysis of high resolution color orthophotos which were acquired in the time frame 2005-2011. In the New Italian Glacier Inventory 903 glaciers are described, covering a total area of 369.90 km2 ± 2{\%}. The largest part of the glacier coverage is located in the Aosta Valley Autonomous Region (36.15 {\%} of the total), followed by the Lombardy Region (23.71 {\%}) and the Autonomous Province of Bolzano (23.01 {\%}). The highest number of glaciers was found in Lombardy (230), then in the Autonomous Province of Bolzano (212), in the Aosta Valley Autonomous Region (192), and in the Autonomous Province of Trento (115). About 84 {\%} of the census is composed by glaciers minor than 0.5 km2 covering only the 21{\%} of the total area. Glaciers wider than 1 km2 are 9.4 {\%} of the whole number, but they cover 67.8 {\%} of the total area. In the widest size class ({\textgreater}10 km2), only three glaciers are found. Only 25 glaciers (2.8 {\%} of the census) were classified as valley glacier, while the largest part (57.3{\%}) was classified as mountain glacier and glacieret (40{\%}), thus underlining that the Italian glaciers are spread into several small ice bodies with few larger glaciers. A first comparison between the total area reported in the New Italian Glacier Inventory and the value reported in the CGI CNR Inventory (1959-1962) suggests an overall reduction of the glacier coverage of about 30{\%} (from 526.88 km2 in the Sixties to 369.90 km2 in the present time). A second comparison was performed with the WGI (World Glacier Inventory) dataset which in the Eighties listed 1381 Italian glaciers covering a total area of 608.56 km2. This comparison suggests a loss of 478 glaciers and an area reduction of 238.66 km2 (-39 {\%}).},

abstract = {Controls on the global distribution of surge-type glaciers hold the keys to a better understanding of surge mechanisms. We investigate correlations between the distribution of surge-type glaciers and climatic and glacier geometry variables, using a new global geodatabase of 2317 surge-type glaciers. The highest densities of surge-type glaciers occur within an optimal climatic envelope bounded by temperature and precipitation thresholds. Across all regions with both surge-type and normal glaciers, the former are larger, especially at the cold, dry end of the climatic spectrum. A species distribution model, Maxent, accurately predicts the major clusters of surge-type glaciers using a series of climatic and glacier geometry variables, but under-predicts clusters found outside the climatically optimal surge zone. We interpret the results in terms of a new enthalpy cycle model. Steady states require a balance between enthalpy gains generated by the balance flux and losses via heat conduction and meltwater discharge. This condition can be most easily satisfied in cold, dry environments (thin, low-flux glaciers, efficient conductive heat losses) and warm, humid environments (high meltwater discharges). Intermediate conditions correspond to the optimal surge zone, where neither heat conduction nor runoff can effectively discharge enthalpy gains, and dynamic cycling can result.},

Changes in surface elevation and volume are determined by differencing a digital elevation model (DEM) derived from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer stereo images in 2005 from the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar DEM of 2014. The glacier area shrunk by 543 ± 123 km 2 (12 ± 3{\%}) between 1986 and 2016. The region-wide mass-balance rate between 2005 and 2014 was −0.94 ± 0.12 m w.e. a −1 (−3.84 ± 0.50 Gt a −1 ), which is almost twice as negative than found for earlier periods in previous studies indicating an acceleration in glacier mass loss in this region. Area-averaged mass changes were most negative for lake-terminating glaciers (−1.37 ± 0.13 m w.e. a −1 ), followed by land-terminating glaciers (−1.02 ± 0.13 m w.e. a −1 ) and tidewater glaciers (−0.45 ± 0.14 m w.e. a −1 ). Unambiguous attribution of the observed acceleration in mass loss over the last decades is hampered by the scarcity of observational data, especially at high elevation, and by large interannual variability.},

abstract = {Abstract. We present a new glacier inventory for high-mountain Asia named "Glacier Area Mapping for Discharge from the Asian Mountains" (GAMDAM). Glacier outlines were delineated manually using 356 Landsat ETM+ scenes in 226 path-row sets from the period 1999–2003, in conjunction with a digital elevation model (DEM) and high-resolution Google EarthTM imagery. Geolocations are largely consistent between the Landsat imagery and DEM due to systematic radiometric and geometric corrections made by the United States Geological Survey. We performed repeated delineation tests and peer review of glacier outlines in order to maintain the consistency and quality of the inventory. Our GAMDAM glacier inventory (GGI) includes 87 084 glaciers covering a total area of 91 263 ± 13 689 km2 throughout high-mountain Asia. In the Hindu Kush–Himalaya range, the total glacier area in our inventory is 93{\%} that of the ICIMOD (International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development) inventory. Discrepancies between the two regional data sets are due mainly to the effects of glacier shading. In contrast, our inventory represents significantly less surface area (−24{\%}) than the recent global Randolph Glacier Inventory, version 4.0 (RGI), which includes 119 863 ± 9201 km2 for the entirety of high Asian mountains. Likely causes of this disparity include headwall definition, effects of exclusion of shaded glacier areas, glacier recession since the 1970s, and inclusion of seasonal snow cover in the source data of the RGI, although it is difficult to evaluate such effects quantitatively. Further rigorous peer review of GGI will both improve the quality of glacier inventory in high-mountain Asia and provide new opportunities to study Asian glaciers.},

abstract = {Abstract. Monitoring glacier fluctuations provides insights into changing glacial environments and recent climate change. The availability of satellite imagery offers the opportunity to view these changes for remote and inaccessible regions. Gaining an understanding of the ongoing changes in such regions is vital if a complete picture of glacial fluctuations globally is to be established. Here, satellite imagery (Landsat 7, 8 and ASTER) is used to conduct a multi-annual remote sensing survey of glacier fluctuations on the Kamchatka Peninsula (eastern Russia) over the 2000–2014 period. Glacier margins were digitised manually and reveal that, in 2000, the peninsula was occupied by 673 glaciers, with a total glacier surface area of 775.7 ± 27.9 km2. By 2014, the number of glaciers had increased to 738 (reflecting the fragmentation of larger glaciers), but their surface area had decreased to 592.9 ± 20.4 km2. This represents a ∼ 24 {\%} decline in total glacier surface area between 2000 and 2014 and a notable acceleration in the rate of area loss since the late 20th century. Analysis of possible controls indicates that these glacier fluctuations were likely governed by variations in climate (particularly rising summer temperatures), though the response of individual glaciers was modulated by other (non-climatic) factors, principally glacier size, local shading and debris cover.},

The glaciers retreated through the first half of the 20th century, advanced slightly from the mid-1940s to the end of the century and have retreated slightly since. High interannual variability in area and temporal gaps in data complicate the trends. Local climate records indicate a lack of systematic change between 1950 and 1975, but significant warming afterwards. Local topographic effects (e.g. wind redistribution of snow and avalanching) are important influences. These small glaciers respond to changes in regional climate; summer temperature alone is a good predictor of the mass balance of Andrews Glacier ( r = -0.93). Spring snowfall is also an important factor. That winter precipitation is not statistically significant supports the notion that these small glaciers gain much snow from wind drift and avalanching, making winter snow accumulation almost indifferent to variations in direct snowfall. Less than expected glacier retreat may be due to increased summer cloudiness.},

We express the sensitivity of mass-balance rate to ELA, d Ḃ/ dELA, as a function of accumulation–area ratio (AAR), its derivative against altitude, dAAR/dELA, and mass-balance functions of ELA. We then apply the concept to 139 glaciers in the Southern Patagonia Icefield for which we derive hypsometry and AAR, and analyze the influence of hypsometry on their mass-balance rate sensitivity. We confirm that glaciers where the bulk of area is located above (below) the ELA are the least (most) sensitive. Glaciers with unimodal hypsometric curves where the peak of area fraction is around the present ELA, and glaciers with bi-or multimodal area distributions, with the ELA located approximately between the bulges, have intermediate sensitivities. We conclude that hypsometry can be used as a first-order estimator of mass-balance rate sensitivity to ELA change.},

Since the last glacier inventory was compiled in northern Norway in the 1970s, marked fluctuations in glacier length and mass balance have been reported for individual glaciers, and the current overall glacier state is thus not well known. Within the framework of the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) initiative, we have created a new inventory for 489 glaciers in the Svartisen region, northern Norway, using a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite scene from 7 September 1999 and automated multispectral glacier mapping (thresholded band ratios). In addition, visual inspection and correction of the generated glacier outlines has been applied. Adverse snow conditions and uncertain drainage divides made glacier mapping challenging in some regions of the study site. Glacier outlines from 1968, as digitized from a topographic map, were used for a quantitative change assessment for a selection of 300 glaciers. The overall area change of this sample from 1968 to 1999 was close to zero, but with a strongly increasing scatter towards smaller glaciers, large area gains ({\textgreater}50{\%}) for small glaciers ({\textless}1 km 2 ), and an unexpected stronger relative area loss towards the wetter coast. The overall size changes are small ({\textless}1{\%}) for the three largest ice masses in the study region (Vestisen, {\O}stisen and Bl{\aa}mannsisen).},

It was considered essential to an understanding of the role played by glaciers in the hydrological cycle and was to be repeated every 50 years to detect change. To date, 46{\%} of the estimated total glacier area has been inventoried and made available through the World Glacier Monitoring Service and the US National Snow and Ice Data Center. As the original inventory method was too time-consuming and inapplicable for some areas, a simplified method was developed in the early 1980s using satellite images. The Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) project now covers 34{\%} of the estimated glacierized area outside Greenland and Antarctica. Both inventory efforts have made good progress and contributed substantially to our knowledge of glaciology and its related sciences, but global coverage is still incomplete. If both inventories are combined, 46{\%} of the world's glacierized area is still missing; 26{\%} is covered by both methods, which allows the quality of the satellite-based and semi-automatic inventories to be assessed by comparison. About 95 000 glaciers remain to be inventoried, of which about half are in the Canadian Cordillera, South America and the Canadian Arctic Islands. As the cryosphere is changing rapidly, it is of the utmost importance to complete the global glacier inventory as soon as possible, and identify an appropriate repeat cycle.},

While there have been partial updates using 2002 and 2009 satellite data, most glaciers are still represented by the 1978 outlines in contemporary global glacier databases. The objective of this project is to establish an updated glacier inventory for New Zealand. We have used Landsat 8 OLI satellite imagery from February and March 2016 for delineating clean glaciers using a semi-automatic band ratio method and debris-covered glaciers using a maximum likelihood classification. The outlines have been checked against Sentinel-2 MSI data, which have a higher resolution. Manual post processing was necessary due to misclassifications (e.g. lakes, clouds), mapping in shadowed areas, and combining the clean and debris-covered parts into single glaciers. New Zealand glaciers cover an area of 794 ± 34 km 2 in 2016 with a debris-covered area of 10{\%}. Of the 2918 glaciers, seven glaciers are {\textgreater}10 km 2 while 71{\%} is {\textless}0.1 km 2 . The debris cover on those largest glaciers is {\textgreater}40{\%}. Only 15 glaciers are located on the North Island.

The glacier survives well below the climatological equilibrium line altitude because of substantial inputs from avalanching and windblown snow. The glacier survived two of the hottest summers on record in 2003 and 2007, although it experienced significant retreat. However, during the intervening years (2004-2006) the glacier increased in size and advanced, forming a new frontal moraine. This rapid advance was primarily in response to much cooler summer temperatures, close to or cooler than average, and a marked increase in winter precipitation. The rapid growth and decay of the Debeli Namet glacier in response to inter-annual climate variability highlights the sensitivity of small cirque glaciers to short-term climate change. {\textcopyright} 2008 Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography.},

abstract = {Five small glaciers in the Bavarian Alps have been surveyed repeatedly since the late 19th century. This enables the calculation of geodetic glacier mass balances, which are known to be key indicators for climate fluctuations. In this paper, the record is extended by the analysis of additional historical maps and by a new survey of the glacier surfaces in 2009/2010. After the 1960s and 1970s, when positive mass balances could be observed, the glaciers experienced severe mass losses, which is consistent with observations from the vast majority of mountain glaciers worldwide. Although the glaciers show individual behaviour which can be explained by topographic peculiarities, the overall trend is an intensified surface lowering during the past decades. To identify the local causes and triggers, homogenized climate data from stations near the glaciers have been analyzed. All records show an extensive warming in summer, but no increase over the altitudinal gradient. Winter precipitation shows little variation on a decadal time scale and reveals no significant trends over time. An analysis of snow height and winter precipitation measurements at Zugspitze proved that the precipitation measurements are not capable to explain glacier behaviour due to gauge undercatch and redistribution of snow by wind. Correlations between geodetically derived glacier mass balances and mean seasonal meteorological conditions indicate that mass losses are mainly caused by increased summer air temperatures. However, mean seasonal values cannot take into account fluctuations of the temporary snow line, which are crucial for the mass balance of small glaciers and which can only be considered using a daily time-step model.},

The local glaciers and ice caps on Greenland are of particular interest for such efforts, as they have been only partly mapped, mainly during the 1940s–60s, and their potential contribution to global sea-level rise could be large. Here we use three Landsat ETM+ scenes from 2001 covering Disko Island (Qeqertarsuaq) and the Nuussuaq and Svartenhuk peninsulas, West Greenland, to map the glacier extent in 2001 of 1172 entities. We also manually digitize Little Ice Age (LIA) extents from clearly visible trimlines for a subsample of 500 entities. In this region with numerous surge-type glaciers, the related area-change calculation is challenging and we consider different samples with and without known surging glaciers. For the three regions the mean area changes are –28{\%}, –20{\%} and –23{\%}, respectively, when known surge-type glaciers are excluded. The glaciers on smaller islands and peninsulas closer to the margin of the ice sheet show a lower mean area change of –15{\%}. Moreover, lower (–16{\%}) and upper (–21{\%}) bounds are calculated for the overall area changes in the entire region between the LIA and 2001 using different upscaling assumptions. Cumulative length changes since the LIA are found to be slightly lower for surge-type glaciers.},

abstract = {The percentage hypsometric curve (area-altitude curve) relates horizontal cross-sectional area of a drain- age basin to relative elevation above basin mouth. By use of dimensionless parameters, curves can be de- scribed and compared irrespective of true scale. Curves show distinctive differences both in sinuosity of form and in proportionate area below the curve, here termed the hypsometric integral. A simple three-variable function provides a satisfactory series of model curves to which most natural hypsometric curves can be fitted. The hypsometric curve can be equated to a mean ground-slope curve if length of contour belt is taken into account. Stages of youth, maturity, and old age in regions of homogeneous rock give a distinctive series of hyp- sometric forms, but mature and old stages give identical curves unless monadnock masses are present. It is therefore proposed that this terminology be replaced by one consisting of an inequilibrium stage, an equilib- rium stage, and a monadnock phase. Detailed morphometric analysis of basins in five sample areas in the equilibrium stage show distinctive, though small, differences in hypsometric integrals and curve forms. In general, drainage basin height, slope steepness, stream channel gradient, and drainage density show a good negative correlation with mean integrals. Lithologic and structural differences between areas or recent minor uplifts may account for certain curve differences. Regions of strong horizontal structural benching give a modified series of hypsometric curves. Practical applications of hypsometric analysis are foreseen in hydrology, soil erosion and sedimenta- tion studies, and military science.},

The work was carried out at the No egian Polar Institute where all the background information is available. Most of the work was done in 1980-81 . The topographical maps used are on a scale of 1:100,000 and were made by the cartographical section of the No e­ gian Polar Institute for the Svalbard map series project. Many have been upda­ ted or totally revised during the past ten years. However, some which had been constructed from aerial photographs dating from 1936 showed glacier areas and glacier fronts that had not been updated. Because most glacier areas have been shrinking since the 1930's, aerial photographs on a 1:50,000 scale taken in 1960, 1966 and 1969-71 have been used to update the extent of the glaciers and investigate the moraine morphology associated with them. Land­ sat satellite images from August 1980 which show glacier front positions on calving glaciers were also used in the compilation. The new aerial photography carried out in the summer of 1990, which covers the whole of Svalbard, was not used for this invento . These photos would most likely have con rmed the general retreat of the glaciers because of the negative mass balance on most glaciers during the present centu . Consequently, the volu es and areas given in this invento are probably slightly overestimated compared to the 1990 situation. Treating each drainage basin separately, the invento gives information about eve glacier that exceeds 1 km2 in area. Smaller ones were also measured, but are not listed or tabulated individually. Although these comprise as much as 56{\%} of the total number, they cover only 1 . 1{\%} of the glaciated area. Radio-echo soundings were carried out by Russian, Norwegian and British scientists. An empirical formula based on these soundings has been used to estimate the depths and volumes of most of the glaciers.},

abstract = {The Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) project has developed tools and methods that can be employed by analysts to create accurate glacier outlines. To illustrate the importance of accurate glacier outlines and the effectiveness of GLIMS standards we conducted a case study on Bering Glacier System (BGS), Alaska. BGS is a complex glacier system aggregated from multiple drainage basins, numerous tributaries, and many accumulation areas. Published measurements of BGS surface area vary from 1740 to 6200 km2, depending on how the boundaries of this system have been defined. Utilizing GLIMS tools and standards we have completed a new outline (3630 km2) and analysis of the area-altitude distribution (hypsometry) of BGS using Landsat images from 2000 and 2001 and a US Geological Survey 15-min digital elevation model. We compared this new hypsometry with three different hypsometries to illustrate the errors that result from the widely varying estimates of BGS extent. The use of different BGS hypsometries results in highly variable measures of volume change and net balance ({\textless}I{\textgreater}bn{\textless}/I{\textgreater}). Applying a simple hypsometry-dependent mass-balance model to different hypsometries results in a {\textless}I{\textgreater}bn{\textless}/I{\textgreater} rate range of {\&}minus;1.0 to {\&}minus;3.1 m a{\&}minus;1 water equivalent (W.E.), a volume change range of {\&}minus;3.8 to {\&}minus;6.7 km3 a{\&}minus;1 W.E., and a near doubling in contributions to sea level equivalent, 0.011 mm a{\&}minus;1 to 0.019 mm a{\&}minus;1. Current inaccuracies in glacier outlines hinder our ability to correctly quantify glacier change. Understanding of glacier extents can become comprehensive and accurate. Such accuracy is possible with the increasing volume of satellite imagery of glacierized regions, recent advances in tools and standards, and dedication to this important task. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2008.},

abstract = {Abstract. The investigation of surging glaciers using remote sensing has recently seen a strong increase as freely available satellite data and digital elevation models (DEMs) can provide detailed information about surges that often take place in remote and inaccessible regions. Apart from analysing individual surges, satellite information is increasingly used to collect valuable data on surging glaciers. Related inventories have recently been published for several regions in High Mountain Asia including the Karakoram or parts of the Pamir and western Kunlun Shan, but information for the entire Pamir is solely available from a historic database listing about 80 glaciers with confirmed surges. Here we present an updated inventory of confirmed glacier surges for the Pamir that considers results from earlier studies and is largely based on a systematic analysis of Landsat image time series (1988 to 2018), very high-resolution imagery (Corona, Hexagon, Bing Maps, Google Earth) and DEM differences. Actively surging glaciers (e.g. with advancing termini) were identified from animations and flicker images and the typical elevation change patterns (lowering in an upper reservoir zone and thickening further down in a receiving zone). In total, we identified 206 spatially distinct surges within 186 glacier bodies mostly clustered in the northern and western part of the Pamir. Where possible, minimum and maximum glacier extents were digitised, but often interacting tributaries made a clear separation challenging. Most surging glaciers (n=70) are found in the larger size classes ({\textgreater}10 km2), but two of them are very small (},

abstract = {Mapping changes in glacier extent from repeat optical satellite data has revealed widespread glacier decline in nearly all regions of the world over the past few decades. While numerous studies have documented the changes of the outlet glaciers of the Northern and Southern Patagonia Icefields (NPI/SPI), information about glacier changes in the Patagonian Andes (to the north of the NPI) is much scarcer. Here we present an assessment of area changes for glaciers mainly located in the Palena district of Chile based on glacier inventories for 1985, 2000 and 2011 that were derived from two consecutive Landsat scenes and a digital elevation model. The analysis revealed a dramatic area decline for the largest glaciers and total area loss of 25{\%} from 1985 to 2011. The lower parts of several larger glaciers ({\textgreater}10 km 2 ) melted completely. Area loss below 1000 m elevation was 50–100{\%} in both periods, and 374 glaciers out of 1664 disappeared. The number of proglacial lakes increased from 223 to 327 and their area expanded by 11.6 km 2 (59{\%}) between 1985 and 2011. Seasonal snow persisting at high elevations in the 2011 scene was a major obstacle to glacier delineation, so the obtained area change rate of {\~{}}1{\%} a –1 over the entire period is a lower-bound estimate. The observed climate trends (e.g. cooling in Puerto Montt) are in contrast to the observed shrinkage.},

abstract = {Glaciers in the Karakoram exhibit irregular behavior. Terminus fluctuations of individual glaciers lack consistency and, unlike other parts of the Himalaya, total ice mass remained stable or slightly increased since the 1970s. These seeming anomalies are addressed through a comprehensive mapping of surge-type glaciers and surge-related impacts, based on satellite images (Landsat and ASTER), ground observations, and archival material since the 1840s. Some 221 surge-type and surge-like glaciers are identified in six main classes. Their basins cover 7,734 ± 271 km 2 or {\~{}}43{\%} of the total Karakoram glacierised area. Active phases range from some months to over 15 years. Surge intervals are identified for 27 glaciers with two or more surges, including 9 not previously reported. Mini-surges and kinematic waves are documented and surface diagnostic features indicative of surging. Surge cycle timing, intervals and mass transfers are unique to each glacier and largely out-of-phase with climate. A broad class of surge-modified ice introduces indirect and post-surge effects that further complicate tracking of climate responses. Mass balance in surge-type and surge-modified glaciers differs from conventional, climate-sensitive profiles. New approaches are required to account for such differing responses of individual glaciers, and effectively project the fate of Karakoram ice during a warming climate.},

abstract = {Very few global-scale ice volume estimates are available for mountain glaciers and ice caps, although such estimates are crucial for any attempts to project their contribution to sea level rise in the future. We present a statistical method for deriving regional and global ice volumes from regional glacier area distributions and volume area scaling using glacier area data from ∼ 123,000 glaciers from a recently extended World Glacier Inventory. We compute glacier volumes and their sea level equivalent (SLE) for 19 glacierized regions containing all mountain glaciers and ice caps on Earth. On the basis of total glacierized area of 741 x 103 ± 68 x 10 km2, we estimate a total ice volume of 241 x 103 ± 29 x 10 3 km3, corresponding to 0.60 ± 0.07 m SLE, of which 32{\%} is due to glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica apart from the ice sheets. However, our estimate is sensitive to assumptions on volume area scaling coefficients and glacier area distributions in the regions that are poorly inventoried, i.e., Antarctica, North America, Greenland, and Patagonia. This emphasizes the need for more volume observations, especially of large glaciers and a more complete World Glacier Inventory in order to reduce uncertainties and to arrive at firmer volume estimates for all mountain glaciers and ice caps.

The glacier outlines have been revised and updated for consistency and the most representative outline chosen. The maximum glacier extent during the LIA was not reached simultaneously in Iceland, but many glaciers started retreating from their outermost LIA moraines around 1890. The total area of glaciers in Iceland in 2019 was approximately 10,400 km², and has decreased by more than 2200 km² since the end of the 19th century (corresponding to an 18$\backslash${\%} loss in area) and by approximately 750 km² since ∼2000. The larger ice caps have lost 10–30$\backslash${\%} of their maximum LIA area, whereas intermediate-size glaciers have been reduced by up to 80$\backslash${\%}.

Twelve volumes of the Glacier Inventory of China (GIC) have been published, consisting of 22 parts in 21 books. The data were subsequently abridged into a Concise GIC, published in Chinese (2005) and in English (2008), to make the glacier inventory more accessible and better adapted for assessing glacier response to climate change. After the GIC was completed, new aerial photographs became available and remote-sensing techniques became more common. To investigate glacier changes since completion of the first GIC, a second Glacier Inventory of China was initiated in 2007. This 5 year project, supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, will be undertaken mainly using remote-sensing techniques.},

Unfortunately, such a glacier inventory is still lacking in many remote but extensively glacierized gions such as the Canadian Arctic. Multispectral satellite data in combination with digital elevation models (DEMs) a particularly useful for creating detailed glacier inventory data including topographic information for each entity. In this study, we extracted glacier outlines and a DEM using two adjacent Terra ASTER scenes acquired in August 2000 for a remote region on southern Baffin Island, Canada. Additionally, Little Ice Age (LIA) extents we digitized from trimlines and moraines visible on the ASTER scenes, and Landsat MSS and TM scenes from the years 1975 and 1990 we used to assess changes in glacier length and area. Because automated delineation of glaciers is based on a band in the shortwave infrared, we have developed a new semi-automated glacier-mapping approach for the MSS sensor. Wrongly classified debris-coved glaciers, water bodies and attached snowfields we corrected manually for both ASTER and MSS. Glacier drainage divides we manually digitized by combining visual interptation with DEM information. In this first paper, we describe the applied methods for glacier mapping and the glaciological challenges encounted (e.g. data voids, snow cover, ice caps, tributaries), while the second paper ports the data analyses and the derived changes.},

Satellite imagery from 1999–2010 provided most of the outlines. Their total extent is estimated as 726 800 ± 34 000 km 2 . The uncertainty, about ±5{\%}, is derived from careful single-glacier and basin-scale uncertainty estimates and comparisons with inventories that were not sources for the RGI. The main contributors to uncertainty are probably misinterpretation of seasonal snow cover and debris cover. These errors appear not to be normally distributed, and quantifying them reliably is an unsolved problem. Combined with digital elevation models, the RGI glacier outlines yield hypsometries that can be combined with atmospheric data or model outputs for analysis of the impacts of climatic change on glaciers. The RGI has already proved its value in the generation of significantly improved aggregate estimates of glacier mass changes and total volume, and thus actual and potential contributions to sea-level rise.},

abstract = {The western Nyainqentanglha Range is located in the south-eastern centre of the Tibetan Plateau. Its northwestern slopes drain into Lake Nam Co. The region is of special interest for glacio-climatological research as it is influenced by both the continental climate of Central Asia and the Indian Monsoon system, and situated at the transition zone between temperate and subcontinental glaciers. A glacier inventory for the whole mountain range was generated for the year around 2001 using automated remote sensing and GIS techniques based on Landsat ETM+ and SRTM3 DEM data. Glacier change analysis was based on data from Hexagon KH-9 and Landsat MSS (both 1976), Metric Camera (1984), and Landsat TM/ETM+ (1991, 2001, 2005, 2009). Manual adjustment was especially necessary for delineating the debris-covered glaciers and the glaciers on the panchromatic Hexagon data. In the years around 2001 the whole mountain range contained about 960 glaciers covering an area of 795.6 +/- 22.3 km(2) while the ice in the drainage basin of Nam Co covered 198.1 +/- 5.6 km(2). The median elevation of the glaciers was about 5800 m with the majority terminating around 5600 m. Five glaciers with debris-covered tongues terminated lower than 5200 m. The glacier area decreased by -6.1 +/- 3{\%} between 1976 and 2001. This is less than reported in previous studies based on the 1970s topographic maps and Landsat data from 2000. Glaciers continued to shrink during the period 2001-2009. No advancing glaciers were detected. Detailed length measurements for five glaciers indicated a retreat of around 10 m per year (1976-2009). Ice cover is higher south-east of the mountain ridge which reflects the windward direction to the monsoon. The temperature increase during the ablation period was probably the main driver of glacier wastage, but the complex glacier-climate interactions need further investigation.},

abstract = {Abstract. Changes in the map area of 498 glaciers located on the Main Caucasus ridge (MCR) and on Mt. Elbrus in the Greater Caucasus Mountains (Russia and Georgia) were assessed using multispectral ASTER and panchromatic Landsat imagery with 15 m spatial resolution in 1999/2001 and 2010/2012. Changes in recession rates of glacier snouts between 1987–2001 and 2001–2010 were investigated using aerial photography and ASTER imagery for a sub-sample of 44 glaciers. In total, glacier area decreased by 4.7 ± 2.1{\%} or 19.2 ± 8.7 km2 from 407.3 ± 5.4 km2 to 388.1 ± 5.2 km2. Glaciers located in the central and western MCR lost 13.4 ± 7.3 km2 (4.7 ± 2.5{\%}) in total or 8.5 km2 (5.0 ± 2.4{\%}) and 4.9 km2 (4.1 ± 2.7{\%}) respectively. Glaciers on Mt. Elbrus, although located at higher elevations, lost 5.8 ± 1.4 km2 (4.9 ± 1.2{\%}) of their total area. The recession rates of valley glacier termini increased between 1987–2000/01 and 2000/01–2010 (2000 for the western MCR and 2001 for the central MCR and Mt.{\~{}}Elbrus) from 3.8 ± 0.8, 3.2 ± 0.9 and 8.3 ± 0.8 m yr−1 to 11.9 ± 1.1, 8.7 ± 1.1 and 14.1 ± 1.1 m yr−1 in the central and western MCR and on Mt. Elbrus respectively. The highest rate of increase in glacier termini retreat was registered on the southern slope of the central MCR where it has tripled. A positive trend in summer temperatures forced glacier recession, and strong positive temperature anomalies in 1998, 2006, and 2010 contributed to the enhanced loss of ice. An increase in accumulation season precipitation observed in the northern MCR since the mid-1980s has not compensated for the effects of summer warming while the negative precipitation anomalies, observed on the southern slope of the central MCR in the 1990s, resulted in stronger glacier wastage.},

abstract = {We present a detailed, complete glacier inventory for Alaska and neighboring Canada using multi-sensor satellite data from 2000 to 2011. For each glacier, we derive outlines and 51 variables, including center-line lengths, outline types and debris cover. We find 86 723 km2 of glacier area (27109 glaciers {\textgreater}0.025 km2), ∼12{\%} of the global glacierized area outside ice sheets. Of this area 12.0{\%} is drained by 39 marine-terminating glaciers (74 km of tidewater margin), and 19.3{\%} by 148 lake- and river-terminating glaciers (420 km of lake-/river margin). The overall debris cover is 11{\%}, with considerable differences among regions, ranging from 1.4{\%} in the Kenai Mountains to 28{\%} in the Central Alaska Range. Comparison of outlines from different sources on {\textgreater}2500 km2 of glacierized area yields a total area difference of ∼10{\%}, emphasizing the difficulties in accurately delineating debris-covered glaciers. Assuming fully correlated (systematic) errors, uncertainties in area reach 6{\%} for all Alaska glaciers, but further analysis is needed to explore adequate error correlation scales. Preliminary analysis of the glacier database yields a new set of well-constrained area/length scaling parameters and shows good agreement between our area-altitude distributions and previously established synthetic hypsometries. The new glacier database will be valuable to further explore relations between glacier variables and glacier behavior.},

abstract = {The first satellite-derived inventory of glaciers and rock glaciers in Chile, created from Landsat TM/ETM+ images spanning between 2000 and 2003 using a semi-automated procedure, is presented in a single standardized format. Large glacierized areas in the Altiplano, Palena Province and the periphery of the Patagonian icefields are inventoried. The Chilean glacierized area is 23 708 ± 1185 km 2 , including {\~{}}3200 km 2 of both debris-covered glaciers and rock glaciers. Glacier distribution varies as a result of climatic gradients with latitude and elevation, with 0.8{\%} occurring in the Desert Andes (17°30′–32° S); 3.6{\%} in the Central Andes (32–36° S), 6.2{\%} in the Lakes District and Palena Province (36–46° S), and 89.3{\%} in Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego (46–56° S). Glacier outlines, across all glacierized regions and size classes, updated to 2015 using Landsat 8 images for 98 complexes indicate a decline in areal extent affecting mostly clean-ice glaciers (−92.3 ± 4.6 km 2 ), whereas debris-covered glaciers and rock glaciers in the Desert and Central Andes appear nearly unchanged in their extent. Glacier attributes estimated from this new inventory provide valuable insights into spatial patterns of glacier shrinkage for assessing future glacier changes in response to climate change.},

abstract = {Due to adverse snow and cloud conditions, only a few inventories are available for the maritime glaciers in New Zealand. These are difficult to compare as different approaches and baseline data have been used to create them. In consequence, glacier fluctuations in New Zealand over the past two decades are only known for a few glaciers based on field observations. Here we present the results of a new inventory for the ‘year 2000' (some scenes are from 2001 and 2002) that is based on glacier outlines from a recently published inventory for the year 2016 and allowed consistent change assessment for nearly 3000 glaciers over this period. The year 2000 inventory was created by manual on-screen digitizing using Landsat ETM+ satellite imagery (15 m panchromatic band) in the background and the year 2016 outlines as a starting point. Major challenges faced were late and early seasonal snow, clouds and shadow, the geo-location mismatch between Landsat and Sentinel-2 as well as the correct interpretation of ice patches and ice under debris cover. In total, we re-mapped 2967 glaciers covering an area of 885.5 km 2 in 2000, which is 91.7 km 2 (or 10.4{\%}) more than the 793.8 km 2 mapped in 2016. Area change rates (mean rate −0.65{\%} a −1 ) increase towards smaller glaciers. Strongest area loss from 2000 to 2016 occurred at elevations {\~{}}1900 m but the highest relative loss was found below 800 m a.s.l. In total, 109 glaciers split into two or more entities and 264 had wasted away by 2016.},

abstract = {The effect of climate change on water resources and sea-level rise is largely determined by the size of the ice reservoirs around the world and the ice thickness distribution, which remains uncertain. Here, we present a comprehensive high-resolution mapping of ice motion for 98{\%} of the world's total glacier area during the period 2017–2018. We use this mapping of glacier flow to generate an estimate of global ice volume that reconciles ice thickness distribution with glacier dynamics and surface topography. The results suggest that the world's glaciers have a potential contribution to sea-level rise of 257 ± 85 mm, which is 20{\%} less than previously estimated. At low latitudes, our findings highlight notable changes in freshwater resources, with 37{\%} more ice in the Himalayas and 27{\%} less ice in the tropical Andes of South America, affecting water availability for local populations. This mapping of glacier flow and thickness redefines our understanding of global ice-volume distribution and has implications for the prediction of glacier evolution around the world, since accurate representations of glacier geometry and dynamics are of prime importance to glacier modelling.},

abstract = {Abstract. Glaciers in the Karakoram show long-term irregular behaviour with comparatively frequent and sudden advances. A glacier inventory of the upper Shyok valley situated in northeast Karakoram has been generated for the year 2002 using Landsat ETM+ and SRTM3 DEM as baseline data for the investigations and subsequent change analysis. The upper Shyok valley contained 2123 glaciers (larger than 0.02 km2 in size) with an area of 2977.9 ± 95.3 km2 in 2002. Out of these, 18 glaciers with an area of 1004.1 ± 32.1 km2 showed surge-type behaviour. Change analysis based on Hexagon KH-9 (years 1973 and 1974) and Landsat TM/ETM+ (years 1989, 2002 and 2011) images had to be restricted to a subset of 136 glaciers (covering an area of 1609.7 ± 51.5 km2 in 2002) due to adverse snow conditions. The area of the investigated glaciers, including the 18 surge-type glaciers identified, showed no significant changes during all studied periods. However, the analysis provides a hint that the overall glacier area slightly decreased until about 1989 (area 1973: 1613.6 ± 43.6 km2; area 1989: 1602.0 ± 33.6 km2) followed by an increase (area 2002: 1609.7 ± 51.5; area 2011: 1615.8 ± 35.5 km2). Although the overall change in area is insignificant, advances in glacier tongues since the end of the 1980s are clearly visible. Detailed estimations of length changes for individual glaciers since the 1970s and for Central Rimo Glacier since the 1930s confirm the irregular retreat and advance.},

abstract = {Predicting how climate change will affect glacier and ice sheet flow speeds remains a large hurdle toward accurate sea level rise forecasting. Increases in surface melt rates are known to accelerate glacier flow in summer, whereas in winter, flow speeds are believed to be relatively invariant. Here we show that wintertime flow speeds on nearly all major glaciers throughout Alaska are not only variable but are inversely related to melt from preceding summers. For each additional meter of summertime melt, we observe an 11{\%} decrease in wintertime velocity on glaciers of all sizes, geometries, climates, and bed types. This dynamic occurs because interannual differences in summertime melt affect how much water is retained in the subglacial system during winter. The ubiquity of the dynamic indicates it occurs globally on glaciers and ice sheets not frozen to their beds and thus constitutes a new mechanism affecting sea level rise projections. Key Points Winter flow speeds of glaciers slow 11{\%} for each additional meter of summer melt The response occurs because melt modulates subglacial water storage in winter The dynamic is ubiquitous in Alaska and likely occurs globally in temperate ice {\textcopyright}2013.

However, an up-to-date and alpine-wide inventory for accurate assessment of glacier changes or modelling of future glacier development has not hitherto been available. Here we present a new alpine-wide inventory (covering Austria, France, Italy and Switzerland) derived from ten Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes acquired within 7 weeks in 2003. Combined with the globally available digital elevation model from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, topographic inventory parameters were derived for each of the 3770 mapped glaciers, covering 2050 km 2 . The area-class frequency distribution is very similar in all countries, and a mean northerly aspect (NW, N, NE) is clearly favoured (arithmetic counting). Mean glacier elevation is {\~{}}2900 m, with a small dependence on aspect. The total area loss since the previous glacier inventory (acquired around 1970±15 years) is roughly one-third, yielding a current area loss rate of {\~{}}2{\%}a –1 . Digital overlay of the outlines from the latest Austrian glacier inventory revealed differences in the interpretation of glacier extents that prohibit change assessment.
