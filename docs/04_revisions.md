# Revisions in RGI 7.0 

## Overview

RGI 7.0 includes several major changes compared to RGI 6.0:
- The quality of outlines has been substantially improved in many regions due to inclusion of new updated inventory data.
- New attributes have been added, while others were removed or renamed/redefined.
- Outlines of contiguous glacier complexes are available in addition to the outlines of each individual glaciers ("glacier complex" product).
- New data files including shapefiles of common boundaries of individual glaciers as well as glacier centerlines have been added ("intersects" and "centerlines" products).
- All outlines and attributes are derived exclusively from GLIMS.
- A new largely automated workflow has been developed to generate the RGI from the GLIMS database with the code publicly available to ensure reproducibility.
- Filename conventions have been updated.

Compared to previous versions, the RGI version 7 represents a fundamental change in the data processing workflow and file formatting. Returning users will have to adapt their analysis scripts and routines for them to work with RGI 7.0.

## Glacier outlines

RGI 7.0 contains  substantial improvements in outline quality in many regions of the world. See [](05_description_by_region) for the changes in outlines and data sources.

## Data processing workflow

Previous RGI versions have been generated largely in an ad-hoc manner based on data collected from GLIMS and many individual contributors. Although highly successful in generating the first near-complete global glacier inventory and releasing almost annual updates until 2017, the exact procedures are not fully documented, and code and tools used to generate the dataset not publicly available. A major goal in RGI 7.0 was to largely automate the process with open-source code, and rely exclusively on GLIMS as data source for the generation of the RGI ([Figure 2](fig-workflow)).

:::

The entire production workflow for RGI 7.0 is implemented in Python and is accessible through [this repository](https://github.com/GLIMS-RGI/rgi7_scripts). Here, we provide a summary of the key production steps:

1. **Submission of glacier inventories**: Working groups and analysts continuously submit glacier inventories to GLIMS. This process is often unguided, with data submissions made alongside publications or national inventory deliveries. The RGI consortium occasionally guided the process by setting priorities, such as focusing on poorly covered regions or remapping obviously incorrect outlines. The RGI consortium has also made public requests for data on the GLIMS and Cryolist e-mail listservers ([2020-05-13](https://lists.cryolist.org/pipermail/cryolist/2020-May/005135.html)). 
2. **GLIMS database processing**: The complete GLIMS database was downloaded and processed on the RGI 7.0 production server. This processing involves converting GLIMS outlines to the RGI format (a different data model), cropping the GLIMS files to RGI regions, and performing preliminary data quality checks.
3. **Outline selection and data integrity checks (alpha version)**: A Python script was generated for each RGI region based on the decisions made by the RGI consortium regarding which inventories to include in the RGI. This selection process is documented in [](inventory-selection). After outline selection, technical data integrity checks were conducted (see [](data-integrity)). This step happens after the outline selection, because we aim to correct the data for the RGI quality standards only for the outlines which will be used in the final product. The output at this stage is referred to as the "alpha version." The alpha version is a subset of GLIMS, and it does not yet have RGI attributes or follow RGI naming conventions (except for the organization in first order regions). **Alpha version review process**: The alpha version was then shared with the RGI consortium for review and comments, and the community was invited to provide feedback via email or GitHub. This process sometimes led to changes or updates in the inventories themselves and subsequently in GLIMS. For example in Region 19 (Subantarctic and Antarctic Islands) the review process detected several problems that were addressed by remapping several outlines. Once an inventory was amended or replaced, it was uploaded to GLIMS as a new contribution and needed to be downloaded for the RGI again. The RGI alpha review process was therefore relatively long and iterative, and it occurred in several phases over the course of about one year. 
4. **Attributes generation (beta Version)**: Following the completion of the alpha phase, the regional files were automatically processed into their "beta version," which is the pre-final dataset. Beta files adhere to all RGI requirements, including attributes, names, identifiers, etc. A significant part of the processing workflow involved computing automated attributes such as glacier topography or generating additional products (e.g., the "intersects" or "glacier complex" products). To ensure consistency, the same processing script was applied to all regions. Similar to the alpha phase, the beta version was shared with the community for review and discussion. At this stage, no additional changes to the outlines were permitted, except for cases where major flaws in the outlines were discovered.
5. **Generation of RGI7**: Once the beta files were accepted by the RGI consortium (TODO: how?), the final RGI 7.0 dataset was created by renaming the beta files and storing them in a permanent repository.

For the majority of the regions, several inventories close to the target date are available. TODO: describe the decision process.

## Data and file format

The RGI 7.0 files have been revised to enhance readability and accessibility for both humans and machines. While maintaining a general familiarity with the RGI 6.0 format, we have addressed inconsistencies and implemented a set of rules for generating the data files and data fields. These rules include:

- Script-generated files: All files have been generated using scripts, minimizing the likelihood of human errors during typing or processing. However, it is important to note that this does not guarantee the absence of errors.
- Lowercase naming conventions: File names and field attribute names have been converted to lowercase, making their use more predictable (no mix between lower case and upper case).
- Metadata and documentation: All file attributes have accompanying metadata and documentation, providing additional information and context.
- Standardized file naming conventions: Files have been named according to predefined conventions, allowing for easier machine reading and processing. For instance, the region identifiers are stored in the region description shapefile, enabling the opening of corresponding outline shapefiles in a scripted manner.

Any deviations from these rules should be considered as errors or oversights and will be addressed in future versions.

(data-integrity)=
## Quality control and data integrity

Since the RGI is a subset of GLIMS, all characteristics of GLIMS are inherited by the RGI, including any problems or inaccuracies present in the outlines. However, the RGI workflow  incorporates several data integrity checks on the GLIMS data:

1. **Comparison with original datasets**: Whenever possible, such as when access to the original inventories is available (e.g., GAMDAMv2, {cite:t}`Sakai2019`), the RGI dataset (and consequently GLIMS) was verified against the original dataset. This process helped to identify a few errors in the GLIMS data ingestion workflow. It serves as a rough data integrity check.
2. **Detection of duplicated outlines**: The RGI workflow identifies duplicated outlines by ensuring that no representative point of one outline overlaps with another outline. This filtering process removed a small number of duplicate outlines that exist in GLIMS.
3. **Polygon validity**: The RGI workflow checks and corrects the validity of [polygon geometries](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/common-data-types/geometry-objects.htm). Approximately 2% of the geometries extracted from GLIMS for RGI 7.0 were considered "invalid" based on the Open Geospatial Consortium Implementation Standard. To rectify this, the RGI workflow employs Shapely's `make_valid` function, which eliminates erroneous self-intersections or sliver polygons. The correction process ensures that each glacier's area is preserved within a tolerance of 0.1kmÂ² or 0.1%. In rare cases where this cannot be achieved, one GLIMS entry is split into two geometries, effectively adding two glaciers to the RGI instead of one in GLIMS.
4. **Overlapping area correction**: The RGI workflow checks for and resolves overlapping areas by intersecting geometries with a common boundary and removing overlaps where necessary. However, such cases were rare.

It is important to note that these data integrity checks may result in some outlines in RGI 7.0 being slightly different from the ones stored in GLIMS, although the differences are often imperceptible. Despite these minor discrepancies, the benefits of these data integrity checks are considered to outweigh any deviations from the GLIMS database.
