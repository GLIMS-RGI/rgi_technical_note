# Revisions in RGI7 

```{important}
While being largely consistent with previous RGI versions, the RGI version 7 represents a fundamental change in the data processing workflow and file formatting. Returning users will have to adapt their analysts scripts and routines, hopefully for the better.

## Data sources and outlines

RGI7 contains several considerable improvements in outline quality for many regions of the world.
Refer to [](05_description_by_region) for the changes in outlines and data sources.

## Data processing workflow

Historically, RGI version have been generated and updated "manually", using GIS tools to merge, edit, and prepare the RGI data files. Contributions to the RGI were sent directly to the dataset manager, who was in charge of processing them. This was efficient and without a doubt contributed to the success of the RGI. However, this process was prone to human errors (there weren't many) and relied in a few key persons without whom the dataset could not be maintained or updated. It also led to confusion since there were two databases of glacier outlines: GLIMS and RGI.
