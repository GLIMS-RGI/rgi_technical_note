```{admonition} Version history
:class: note, dropdown

Changes from Version 5.0 to 6.0
: The 37 nominal glaciers in Iran, derived from {cite:t}`Moussavi2009`, were replaced by 200 glacier outlines submitted to GLIMS by Neamat Karimi (Ministry of Energy, Teheran).

Changes from Version 4.0 to 5.0
: Links were added to 7 glaciers in the WGMS mass-balance database.

Changes from Version 3.2 to 4.0
: One exterior GLIMSId was replaced. Topographic and hypsometric attributes were added.<br/>As noted by {cite:t}`Shahgedanova2014`, version 3.2 omitted glaciers in the western and eastern Greater Caucasus. These omissions have been partly rectified by adding nominal glaciers from WGI-XF {cite:t}`Cogley2009a`. The 339 added glaciers, with date ranges 1965–1976, cover 155 km2 and also include some in the central Greater Caucasus (on the Svanets and Lechkhum Ranges to the south of the main ridge of the Caucasus) and in the Lesser Caucasus in Armenia.

Changes from Version 3.0 to 3.2
: None.

Changes from Version 2.0 to Version 3.0
: Outlines of the glaciers of Turkey were provided by M.A. Sarıkaya {cite:p}`Sarkaya2014`.

Changes from Version 1.0 to Version 2.0
: The 37 glaciers of Iran (12-02) were added as nominal circles from {cite:t}`Moussavi2009`.The information available for Turkey {cite:p}`Kurter1991` was not adequate for placing the individual glaciers, which have a total area of 22.9 km2.

Version 1.0
: Outlines of glaciers in the Caucasus were obtained from the GLIMS database.
