## Changes from version 6.0 to 7.0

All RGI6.0 outlines have been replaced, representing a considerable change and improvement to RGI 6.0. 

**Caucasus**

The RGI 7.0 Glacier outlines for the Greater Caucasus were manually digitized by {cite:t}`Tielidze2022`. The primary source of the database was Landsat scenes from 1999-2002. The Greater Caucasus inventory (including 95% of the region's glaciers) was created based on ASTER and Landsat imagery from 1999–2004 {cite:p}`Khromova2016a`. The dataset was incomplete and RGI 6.0 incorporated "nominal glaciers" (circles covering an area equivalent to glacier size) in the eastern and western Greater Caucasus sections {cite:p}`Tielidze2018`. The RGI 6.0 outlines also had inconsistent geolocation which was corrected in RGI 7.0.

**Middle East**

Glaciers of the Middle East have also been revised in detail and digitized based on Landsat imagery from 1998-2001. Overall, glacier outlines from the Caucasus and Middle East region in RGI 7.0 dates range between 1998 and 2002, with most of the area dating to 2000. Most of the glacier outlines for the Middle East in RGI 6.0 were mapped based on the ASTER imagery from 2004-2006 (Turkey) and Landsat scenes from 2011 (Iran). A closer look revealed that most of these outlines were digitized based on snow patches and not actual glaciers.

```{admonition} Version history
:class: note, dropdown

Changes from Version 5.0 to 6.0
: The 37 nominal glaciers in Iran, derived from {cite:t}`Moussavi2009`, were replaced by 200 glacier outlines submitted to GLIMS by Neamat Karimi (Ministry of Energy, Teheran).

Changes from Version 4.0 to 5.0
: Links were added to 7 glaciers in the WGMS mass-balance database.

Changes from Version 3.2 to 4.0
: One exterior GLIMSId was replaced. Topographic and hypsometric attributes were added.<br/>As noted by {cite:t}`Shahgedanova2014`, version 3.2 omitted glaciers in the western and eastern Greater Caucasus. These omissions have been partly rectified by adding nominal glaciers from WGI-XF {cite:t}`Cogley2009a`. The 339 added glaciers, with date ranges 1965–1976, cover 155 km2 and also include some in the central Greater Caucasus (on the Svanets and Lechkhum Ranges to the south of the main ridge of the Caucasus) and in the Lesser Caucasus in Armenia.

Changes from Version 3.0 to 3.2
: None.

Changes from Version 2.0 to Version 3.0
: Outlines of the glaciers of Turkey were provided by M.A. Sarıkaya {cite:p}`Sarkaya2014`.

Changes from Version 1.0 to Version 2.0
: The 37 glaciers of Iran (12-02) were added as nominal circles from {cite:t}`Moussavi2009`.The information available for Turkey {cite:p}`Kurter1991` was not adequate for placing the individual glaciers, which have a total area of 22.9 km2.

Version 1.0
: Outlines of glaciers in the Caucasus were obtained from the GLIMS database.
