## Changes from version 6.0 to 7.0

This region was added in RGI 7.0. The previous first-order region `19` was split into two regions: former subregion `19-31` was removed from region `19` and now defines the new first-order region `20`. The split was motivated by the fact that RGI 7.0 and all previous versions included a complete inventory of the glaciers on the islands in the periphery of mainland Antarctica, but no glaciers on the mainland itself, although inventories (though incomplete) exist.
