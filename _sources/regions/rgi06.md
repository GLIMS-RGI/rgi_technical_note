Changes from Version 4.0 to 5.0
: Links were added to 9 glaciers in the WGMS mass-balance database.

Changes from Version 3.2 to 4.0
: One exterior GLIMSId was replaced. Topographic and hypsometric attributes were added.

Changes from Version 3.0 to 3.2
: Glaciers were delineated from the glacier complexes.

Changes from Version 2.0 to Version 3.0
: None.

Changes from Version 1.0 to Version 2.0
: None.

Version 1.0
: Outlines of glacier complexes in Iceland were added to the GLIMS database by O. Sigurðsson and extracted therefrom by J.G. Cogley, who merged nunataks with the glacier complexes containing them. Most outlines were acquired from 1999–2004 ASTER and SPOT5 imagery; some in the north of Iceland were acquired from oblique aerial photographs.
