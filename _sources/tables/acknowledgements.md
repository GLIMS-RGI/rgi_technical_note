Funding for RGI 7.0 was provided by:
- the **International Association of Cryospheric Sciences (IACS)**, under the auspices of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG). Funds were used to organize meetings and employ student helpers.
- the **UNESCO** Programme and Budget 2022-2023 (41C/5), Major Programme II, Output 3.SC2: "Water science, innovation, education, management, cooperation and governance bolstered for a water secure world in a changing environment" and within the framework of the theme: "Supporting Member States to address hydrological challenges, extremes and water scarcity". Funds (granted to Fabien Maussion) were used to employ student helpers.
- the **World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS)**. Funds were used to employ student helpers.
- the **Copernicus Climate Changes Service (C3S)** implemented by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Funds supported the glacier mapping in regions 01, 03, 04, 05, 07, 10, 11, 16, 17, 18, and 19 by Frank Paul and Philipp Rastner 
- the **ESA project Glaciers_cci** (Grant: 4000127593/19/I-NB). Funds supported the glacier mapping in regions 04 and 18 by Frank Paul
